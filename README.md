# ✈️ Airline Operations & Revenue Analysis — Power BI Project

This Power BI dashboard analyzes synthetic airline data to uncover key business insights on revenue, passenger demographics, and route performance. The project focuses on optimizing airline operations, enhancing customer targeting, and maximizing profitability through data-driven decisions.

## 📊 **Project Overview**
The dashboard visualizes the **total revenue**, **passenger demographics**, and **flight performance** across various airlines and destinations. Interactive visuals allow stakeholders to filter data by passenger age groups, gender, airline, and destinations, offering detailed insights for actionable business strategies.

### **Key Features of the Dashboard:**
- **Revenue by Age Group**: Visualizes the contribution of each age segment to total revenue.
- **Top Destinations**: Displays revenue from top-performing routes.
- **Airline Performance**: Comparative analysis of airline performance by total revenue and passengers.
- **Gender Demographics**: Breakdown of passenger engagement by gender.
- **Interactive Filters**: Allows users to drill down into specific data points, enhancing usability.
- **KPIs**: Key metrics like total revenue, average revenue per flight, and total passengers.

## 🛠 **Tools & Technologies Used**
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive dashboards with dynamic visuals.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Used to calculate key metrics such as revenue totals and averages.
- **Power Query**: To clean and transform data for analysis.
- **Excel**: Used for the initial dataset manipulation and data validation before import to Power BI.

## 📂 **Data Source**
The dataset used in this project is **synthetic**, created using AI tools (ChatGPT) for educational and portfolio purposes. It simulates airline operations data, including:
- **Passenger Age Group**
- **Passenger Gender**
- **Airline**
- **Destination**
- **Revenue per Flight**
- **Booking Count**
  
The data was cleaned using **Power Query** in Power BI to:
- Remove null values,
- Standardize airline names,
- Create relationships between different data tables (e.g., passengers, airlines, destinations).

## 📁 **Files Included**
- **`Airline_Analysis.pdf`**: The final, fully interactive dashboard in PDF format.
- **`Airline_Analysis.pbix`**: Power BI source file (optional if shared).
- **`Screenshots/`**: Folder containing visual snapshots of the dashboard (useful if you want to show how the report looks without needing the Power BI file).
- **`Data_Notes.txt`**: A brief document explaining the synthetic dataset and the cleaning steps performed.

## 📝 **Project Workflow**
1. **Data Collection**: Generated a synthetic dataset representing airline operations, including flights, bookings, and revenue data by destination and passenger demographics.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Utilized **Power Query** to clean the data — handling missing values, transforming columns, and filtering out irrelevant rows.
3. **Data Modeling**: Built relationships between the tables in Power BI, ensuring that the data structure supported smooth visualizations and interactive filters.
4. **Visualization**: Designed a user-friendly dashboard to display the data insights — focused on **revenue breakdowns**, **age group analysis**, and **airline performance**.
5. **Analysis**: Interpreted the insights to provide strategic recommendations for improving revenue and optimizing flight routes.
